This section is an overview of my experience in business analytics. In the various cases and professional writing pieces,
  I illustrate my understanding how information technology, businesses, and the individual interact. 
  
Throughout my Management of Information Systems course, I was able to explore the strategic development of information technology; 
  perform value chain analysis and discover its application to information resource management and information systems planning;
  learn how different types of organizations organize, staff, and control the deployment of information technology;
  I learned how organizations devlop an IT platform and architecture consistent with their organizational structure and strategy.
