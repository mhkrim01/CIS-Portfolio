This section provides an overview of my experience with analyzing and design an IT system for Sweet Karoline's Cakes.
  I have included the Elaboration Specification of the system and the 5th iteration of my group's system design. 
  In these projects, I completed over 25% of the use cases for the system, and created correlating use case class and sequence diagrams.
  I also developed several of the prototypes, which depict mock order forms and product cards to be used on the site.

In Systems Development I learned about the various development methodologies, tools, and techniques that can be utilized
  when developing a real system. I learned about the various stages of the systems development life cycle, which I've tried to 
  demonstrate here by including the 5th iteration of the system. With each successive iteration and specification the 
  system moved from the planning stage all the way through the design stage.
