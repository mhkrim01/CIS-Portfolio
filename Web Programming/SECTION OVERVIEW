This section of my portfolio outlines my experience in web development. In my various projects I gained experience using C#, Typescript,
  Javascript, JQuery, CSS3, HTML5, Angular, Material Design, and Bootstrap CSS.
  
Throught my co-op and internship experience I was able to gain hands on experience with various web technologies
  and further my skills as web developer.
  In my Web Development and Systems Development course I built applications using technologies such as Angular, .NET Core, and API's.
  I was also exposed to concepts in UI and UX design and how to develop effective prototypes that follow modern design principles.
