This section details my growth in understanding of database concepts, technologies, and SQL.

I knew absolutely nothing about databases or SQL before taking Database Design and Implementation.
  After completing the assignments in the course, my knowledge and comfort with SQL and database terminology improved.
  The queries, ERDs, stored procedures, and triggers, I have included exhibit this growth.
